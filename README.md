# New Mexico Water Data Challenge 2020

## The Challenge  
  
Changes in the Clean Water Act has resulted in the loss of protection for many waterways across the United States. The State of New Mexico wants to quantify the exact length of waterways that have been affected, and which communities are disproportionately impacted.  

## New Mexico Human Development and Water Resources Dashboard  
  
To visualize the scale of this issue, a dashboard using RShiny and hosted on ShinyApps. [This dashboard](https://westerleyy.shinyapps.io/NM_Shiny/) captures the length of waterways that have lost protection in each county, the state of human development as measured by the Human Development Index, and the demographic profile of the county, relative to that of the state.
