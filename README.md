# New Mexico Water Data Challenge 2020

## Overview
This is a repository for the New Mexico Water Data Challenge 2020.  
  
### RShiny Dashboard
This is the [link](https://westerleyy.shinyapps.io/NM_Shiny/) to my RShiny dashboard. Currently, it includes statistics on human development, vulnerability, and demographics. In order to reduce the load on the server, I have simplified vectors of waterbodies while reducing the amount of reactivity.   
  
The next logical step will be to work in state legislative districts.
